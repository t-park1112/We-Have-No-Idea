Managing Change Tools
=====================

 

Choosing which tools to use for the managing change practices stated in the
practice guide include:

#### **Online options: ** - For distant stakeholders

-   **Voice-talk communication (Skype)**

-   **Secure Online repository (Google Drive**)

#### **Offline Options: ** - For localized stakeholders

-   **Meetings at a localized location.**

 

Voice-talk Communication
------------------------

Voice-talk communication software will be used for daily meetings that involve
any stakeholders that are unable to attend stand-up meetings. For example
overseas or distant stakeholders that cannot attend stand-up meetings on a daily
basis. Online resources like Skype can be used effectively as a communication
medium, as it provides webcams for face-to-face talks, and a written chat
feature for stakeholders without Mics. (Yip, 2006)

 

Secure Online Repository
------------------------

A secure online repository for storing, sharing and viewing updated backlogs in
real-time can be used for stakeholders that are distant or for stakeholders that
want a way to be constantly exposed to the backlogs whilst working. Online
resources like Google Drive are secure for only stakeholders involved, and can
be used with the Google Docs feature to update and view documents in real-time.

 

Meetings at a Localized location
--------------------------------

For all stakeholders that are able to travel to a localized location on a daily
basis for daily meetings will be much more beneficial for all parties involved
than having online meetings. Stand-up meetings surpass the effectiveness of
having online meetings, as information can be missed through online
communication and having materials that cannot be shown effectively online can
be demonstrated much more effectively. (Yip, 2006)
