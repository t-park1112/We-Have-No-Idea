# Quality Assurance Practices


## Create a comprehensive project plan
Creating a comprehensive project plan before starting development ensures that all requirements and planning stages are sufficiently documented and defined. The benefits of this are that mistakes and software defects can be minimised before development commences (Kevitt, M., 2010). 

## Create a QA plan
A quality assurance plan is a set of documents that outlines processes that ensure the quality of the product. It is a best practice to have a QA plan as the quality of the software can be defined and used as a basis for improvement in the future (Kevitt, M., 2010).

## Be comprehensive with test planning.
A test plan is a document that describes how testing will be conducted and approached with regards to the resources, scope and objectives of a project (Hower, R., 2016). A test plan is very important to assuring quality of software as it outlines all team members and participants involved and the relationships between them and their responsibilities of testing (Kevitt, M., 2010). A test plan comprises of a number of documents including a test strategy guide, test plan and test cases. By defining all of these documents before testing, all resources can be efficiently allocated and all tools defined as well as picking up any potential issues before testing commences. This minimises costs and improves the quality of the software (Kevitt, M., 2010, pg. 21-25).

## Peer review all work done
A peer review is a process where two or more team members collaborate on determining whether a deliverable meets the requirements of the project plan and is of a sufficient quality. Peer reviews are important to quality assurance as they help project teams evaluate each other's work and share knowledge which improves communication and minimises defects in software (Kevitt, M., 2010).
